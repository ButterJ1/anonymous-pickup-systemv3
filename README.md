## üéØ What This Project Does

Imagine Alice wants to buy something online but doesn't want to give her personal information to the seller or store. With our system, she can pick up her package completely anonymously.

**The Magic**: Alice's personal data never leaves her device. Instead, we generate cryptographic commitments that mathematically represent Alice without containing any of her actual information. Even if Bob (seller) and Charlie (store clerk) collaborate, they can't reverse-engineer Alice's identity from these commitments.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

This system demonstrates three cutting-edge technologies working together:

1. **EIP-7702 Account Abstraction** - Enables sophisticated privacy features with existing wallets
2. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** - Allows Alice to prove she's authorized without revealing who she is  
3. **Cryptographic Commitments** - Creates anonymous identities that can't be reverse-engineered

   ```bash
   npm run build-circuits
   ```

3. **Deploy contracts** (choose one):

   **For Local Development:**
   ```bash
   # Start local Hardhat node first
   npx hardhat node
   
   # Then deploy to local network
   npm run deploy:local

## üé• Visual Demo (README as Video Alternative)

Since our recorded demo was lost due to technical issues, this README serves as a comprehensive walkthrough of the system. The screenshots above show the key moments in Alice's anonymous pickup journey:

### Demo Flow Walkthrough:

1. **Identity Setup** ‚Üí Alice enters real info, system generates anonymous commitments
2. **Order Processing** ‚Üí Bob sees only cryptographic commitment, not Alice's identity  
3. **Store Arrival** ‚Üí Charlie generates store commitment when Alice shows QR code
4. **ZK Proof Magic** ‚Üí Alice proves she's authorized without revealing she's the buyer
5. **Package Pickup** ‚Üí Successful anonymous transaction with full privacy preserved

Each screenshot captures the privacy-preserving technology in action, showing how personal data stays on Alice's device while still enabling secure, verified transactions.

## üîê How the Privacy Magic Works

### The Three-Party Dance

1. **Alice (Buyer)** generates a commitment: `hash(secret, nameHash, phoneLastThree, nonce)`
2. **Bob (Seller)** only sees Alice's commitment, not her identity
3. **Charlie (Store)** generates a third commitment when Alice arrives
4. **Alice proves** she knows the secret behind one of the three commitments using ZK proofs

### What Each Party Sees

**Alice knows:**
- Her personal information (stays on her device)
- All three commitments
- She successfully picked up her package

**Bob (Seller) knows:**
- Someone with commitment `0x1a2b3c4d...` bought his product
- He got paid
- The package was picked up

**Charlie (Store) knows:**
- Someone with the right proof picked up package `PKG-ABC123`
- Age requirements were verified (if applicable)
- The pickup was legitimate

**What nobody can determine:**
- Alice's real name, phone, or address
- The connection between Alice and Bob
- Any personal information beyond the transaction

## üéØ Why This Matters

Every day, millions of people share personal information unnecessarily just to pick up packages. This system proves you can have all the benefits of modern e-commerce‚Äîverification, security, audit trails‚Äîwithout sacrificing privacy.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Privacy by Design**: Personal data never leaves the user's device
- **Cryptographic Security**: Mathematical guarantees, not just promises

- **Future-Ready**: Built on emerging standards (EIP-7702)

## üîÆ What's Next

- **Immediate**: Monitor Web3 tooling ecosystem for EIP-7702 improvements
- **Short-term**: Resolve contract integration issues
- **Long-term**: When MetaMask adds native EIP-7702 support, seamless upgrade to true account abstraction
